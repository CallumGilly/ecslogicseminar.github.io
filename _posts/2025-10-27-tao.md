# Abstract

In this talk I will briefly introduce our ongoing work on developing a graphical calculus for the query containment problem (QCP) under the bag semantics. The decidability of QCP under the bag semantics has been open for thirty years, and is known to be hard. We will focus on a fragment of QCP, and show how the decidability for this fragment can eventually be reduced to some elementary linear programming question, factorising through the so-called max semantics. We will then present some interesting graphical axioms that are sound (but may not be complete) for these semantics. This is joint work with Robin Piedeleu (UCL).
