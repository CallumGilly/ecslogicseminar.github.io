# Abstract
During the past decade of continuous development, the theorem prover Vampire  has become an automated solver for the combined theories of commonly-used data structures. Vampire now supports arithmetic, induction, and higher-order logic. These advances have been made to meet the demands of software verification, enabling Vampire to effectively complement SAT/SMT solvers and aid proof assistants. We explain how best to use Vampire  in practice and review the main changes Vampire has undergone since its last tool presentation, focusing on the engineering principles and design choices we made during this process.
