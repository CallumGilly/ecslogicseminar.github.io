# Abstract
When a random number generator and a large language model both produce strings of symbols, why does only one sound like a conversation? Standard answers—statistics, pattern-matching, next-word prediction—describe how such systems function but not why they reason. Logic, after all, is not the physiology of thought but its form. This talk traces the lineage of that idea from Frege’s grammar of reasoning to Dummett’s justificationism, arguing that the key to understanding AI reasoning lies in semantics rather than mechanics. Yet the reasoning of machines may not mirror our own: it is not grounded in belief or intention, but in the maintenance of inferential coherence across vast linguistic space. Recognising this difference allows us to see that AI systems do reason—but in an alien, distributed sense that reopens classical questions about meaning, understanding, and the limits of logic.
